# 3D-House
OpenGL mini project "3D-House"

A Computer Graphics project based on the concept of a “3D House”. This project implements the view of a 3D House both inside and outside of the house. 
There are 5 components that are placed inside the house they are fan, sofa, tv, a table and a teapot placed on the table. The outside of the house has trees  and a system made  for collecting rain water(rain water harvesting). The house is surrounded  by  a compound wall.
The API’s that are used in implementing these components are glutSolidCube(), glutSolidTeapot(), glutSoildCone()… etc
An animation has been implemented which shows the rotation of the fan inside the house.
Lighting has been implemented  by the inbuilt OPENGL lighting functions.
Menus have been provided to modify the various features such as changing the background, lighting etc.
This project implements both the orthographic and perspective view. Options have been provided in the menu to switch between the views.

The following concepts are implemented:
1)Rotation
2)Translation
3)Scaling
4)Lighting
5)Mouse and Keyboard interactions.
